AGENTCODI brings the Codex workflow directly to Android. The standalone app runs without Termux, Node.js, npm, or a separately configured development environment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> AGENTCODI is currently an early-access release. Features and interface details may change while device testing continues.

## Highlights

- AGENTCODI's own application and test code is written in Java and C++
- Start new Codex threads or continue existing ones
- Stream responses, reasoning summaries, plans, commands, file changes, and tool activity as they happen
- Review requests and approve or reject supported actions from the app
- Load the available models and reasoning levels dynamically
- Work with generated files inside a dedicated project workspace
- Export individual workspace files, generated images, or the complete workspace as a ZIP archive
- English and German interface with automatic device-language detection
- No Termux, Node.js, npm, or manual runtime setup required

## Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Android | Android 10 or newer, API 29+ |
| Architecture | ARM64-v8a |
| Authentication | Sign in with ChatGPT or use an OpenAI API key |
| Connection | A continuous internet connection is required for communication with OpenAI services |

## Installation

1. Open the [latest release](../../releases/latest), expand **Assets**, and download the `.apk` file.
2. Open the downloaded APK from the browser or file manager you used.
3. If Android blocks the installation, open the displayed settings and allow that browser or file manager to **Install unknown apps** or **Allow from this source**. The exact wording depends on the device manufacturer.
4. Return to the APK and select **Install**.
5. Launch AGENTCODI and choose one of the available sign-in methods.

Only install APK files published through the official AGENTCODI release page.


## Current status

AGENTCODI is under active development and is currently being tested on real Android devices. The current release already covers the central mobile workflow: authentication, model selection, conversations, streamed activity, approvals, project workspaces, and file export.

Bug reports should include the AGENTCODI version, Android version, device model, and clear reproduction steps. Never include credentials, access tokens, API keys, or private project data.

## Data and workspace

AGENTCODI communicates with OpenAI services through the authentication method you select. Data handling and billing depend on whether you sign in with ChatGPT or use an API key. See the [official Codex authentication documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/auth) for the differences between both methods.

The working directory is stored in the app's private workspace. To make an output available outside AGENTCODI, export the selected file, generated image, or complete workspace through Android's system document interface.
